1)P => I ( At the beginning, The loop invariant must be true.)
a=1 was assigned so value of x^n start at x^0=1

2){I and B} S {I} ( By executing the loop body, I is not altered.)
a = a*x stays the same

3)(I and (not B)) => Q ( If I is true and B is false, Q is indicated.)
if boolean expresion while( b > n), then the loop will terminate

(4) The absolute axiomatic narration of a while construct needs all of the following must be true, in which "I" is the loop invariant.
the loop terminates ( loop termination)
Loop terminates at b=n
