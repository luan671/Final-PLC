#Tombstone
Safety: At the time of data deallocation, the tombstone is given a value this is illegal for a pointer in the runtime environment, signifying that the variable does not exist. This leads to security of data in terms of memory theft as invalid pointers are prevented by the same which otherwise would have been pointing those memory values which are deallocated.

Implementation cost: Higher memory useage to hold tombstone for all pointers and increased computer overhead as separate processing is required to traverse path from pointer to data through tombstone.

#Lock and keys
Safety: In order to disable all copies of pointers just change the keys of the ordered pair as cell value gets automatically copied.

Implementation cost: Though separate memory is also required here to hold the lock value, the computer overhead is less compared to tombstone as less processing for traversal is required than that for tombstones.
