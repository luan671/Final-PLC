Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. (Released 2011)
It is readable on Virtual machine and if we talk about reliability the language has been developed keeping in mind the problem of concurrency. Instead of waiting for errors to occur it assumes that the error will occur and acts accordingly. It leverages on Erlsngs properties but also aims to provide rapid error detection and friendly convention.

Keywords in Elixir:-In Elixir, when we have a list of tuples and the first item of the tuple (i.e. the key) is an atom, we call it a keyword list. It also provides keyword modules to manipulate the keyword list.

Datatype in Elixir:-Supports both integers and floats. It also supports octal, hexadecimal, binary, strings, atoms, and booleans.

Comparison to java:-

Elixir is Dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications while Java is a concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, language specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible.

Elixir:Concurrency, Functional and Erlang VM

Java:Great libraries, Widely used, and Excellent tooling.

Handling in elixir:-

While other languages would require us to catch/handle exceptions, in Elixir it's actually fine with letting processes fail because we expect supervisors to properly restart our systems. Failing fast is a common philosophy when writing Elixir software.
